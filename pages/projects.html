                <p>This project is part of my Research Assistant positon at KU, under Dr. Amin Enderami. The research I am working on is to identify geographical
                    areas that are more susceptible to flash floods. My task is to design a regression model using <em>machine learning</em> to predict these areas using
                    many different features/factors.

            <div class = "text">
                <p>As my role as software developer for Kanbe's Markets, I was contracted a project to build a server that can be used to visualize many different financial and company
                    needs. To complete this project, I created a <em>REST API</em> to fetch data from an already set up database implemented <em>MongoDB</em>. This API fetched data from
                    database to then visualize the data in graphs.

            <div class = "text">
                <p>During my time at Spirit AeroSystems as an IT intern, I had two projects. The first project was building an online form used for employees to checkout hardware.
                    My goal was to make this as automated as possible. To attain this goal, I implemented the forms using Microsoft's PowerApps. Using PowerApps, I created a form 
                    in which employees will fill out on a tablet. This form then connects to ActiveDirectory, where the user's location is autofilled based on what is in ActiveDirectory. This 
                    way, if employees have not accurately updated their locations in the company's database, they are alerted and saves time for the Help Desk Technicians if they need to see them.

                <p>The second project was creating a PowerBI report for Spirit AeroSystems' Defense Programs. This report was previously manually generated from a user, who had to go
                    into the database, generate a report, and manually create a pivot table. My PowerBI report has replaced a 40+ PowerPoint slide that was released on a monthly basis.
                    It now lets program leaders access their live financial data at their fingerprints.
