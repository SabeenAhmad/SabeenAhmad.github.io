            <h2>KU Research Assistant - Disaster Resiliency</h2>
            <p>This project is part of my Research Assistant positon at KU, under Dr. Amin Enderami. The research I am working on is to identify geographical
                areas that are more susceptible to flash floods. My task is to design a regression model using <em>machine learning</em> to predict these areas using
                many different features/factors.

            <h2>Women in Computing - Website</h2>
            <p>As Website Rep for Women in Computing(WIC) at KU, my job is to oversee the website committee members and development of WIC's website. My duties included
                helping create a page for the website, managing Github -- reviewing code, accepting pull requests, handling merge conflicts, assigning issues, etc.

            <h2>Kanbe's Markets Data - Visualization Software</h2>
            <p>As my role as software developer for Kanbe's Markets, I was contracted a project to build a server that can be used to visualize many different financial and company
                needs. To complete this project, I created a <em>REST API</em> to fetch data from an already set up database implemented <em>MongoDB</em>. This API fetched data from
                database to then visualize the data in graphs.

            <h2>Spirit AeroSystems - PowerApps Form </h2>
            <p>During my time at Spirit AeroSystems as an IT intern, I had two projects. The first project was building an online form used for employees to checkout hardware.
                My goal was to make this as automated as possible. To attain this goal, I implemented the forms using Microsoft's PowerApps. Using PowerApps, I created a form 
                in which employees will fill out on a tablet. This form then connects to ActiveDirectory, where the user's location is autofilled based on what is in ActiveDirectory. This 
                way, if employees have not accurately updated their locations in the company's database, they are alerted and saves time for the Help Desk Technicians if they need to see them.

            </p>
            <h2>Spirit AeroSystems - PowerBI Report </h2>
            <p>The second project was creating a PowerBI report for Spirit AeroSystems' Defense Programs. This report was previously manually generated from a user, who had to go
                into the database, generate a report, and manually create a pivot table. My PowerBI report has replaced a 40+ PowerPoint slide that was released on a monthly basis.
                It now lets program leaders access their live financial data at their fingerprints.
